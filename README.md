My goal in this project were to make sure the codebase follows accessibility standards. I wanted the code to be efficient and clear of all errors for the customer. I made slight adjustments to the code to make it more understanding. I decided to change the HTML file from non-semtantic to semantic, because it helped me become more aware of the various options I have available. 

Working on this assigment helped me be familiar with debugging. I was able to identify the errors, which will help me in the future when I am generating my own code for a project. I also was able to make the code clearer and simnplier by removing repeative codes that can be formed into one element. When I started the assignemnt, the "Social-Media" button was not coded correctly. I simply added an ID to the appropriate heading which linked to the correct "A href" link. This made the website more accessible.
